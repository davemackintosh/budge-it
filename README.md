no web interface, nothing fancy CSV bank statement parser.

exposes data such as 

* Total spending and income with difference for the period in the CSV
* Monthly spending
* Matchers for entry grouping spending habits

fully open source, MIT license and im trying to make it multi-lingual.

# Breaking down
so you want to see your finances? I did (and then I didn't) currently this only works for Natwest bank statements but you can PR me a way to index any other bank's field indexes and ill happilly merge.

running `budge-it {YOUR CSV} {NUMBER OF ROWS TO SKIP} {BANK NAME}`

will give you a butt tonne of information about your finances.

## Adding your bank

**Currently supported banks**

* Natwest
* Halifax (beta)
* HSBC (beta)
* Add yours following the below

Currently, this only supports Natwest bank statements in CSV format. To add a new bank you simply need to take a look at your CSV and create a new [`Indexer`](https://github.com/davemackintosh/budge-it/blob/master/types/base.ts#L13-L19) for your bank. There is a folder of currently existing [bank's indexers here](https://github.com/davemackintosh/budge-it/tree/master/bank-indexes).

## Currencies
Although I've not yet made the effort to make this multi-lingual (I will) I have set up a base for using multiple currencies and formatting of currency in your locale. This is configured by your system's `LANG` environmental (after some jiggery-pokery). This doesn't affect the amounts you see and only shows the relevant currency symbol for your language. If you want to run this for another currency then you can run with LANG=your-lang yarn start

To add your currency, you simply need to add the supported [`locale -a` value](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/locale.1.html) value to map to the [ISO 4217 currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) to the [currency map here](https://github.com/davemackintosh/budge-it/blob/master/utils.ts#L1) 

## Matchers
A matcher is a configuration that tests the entry to output it as either a necessary item or an unnecessary expenditure and counts towards what you could have saved (but didn't) or had to spend.

You can [add your own matchers here](https://github.com/davemackintosh/budge-it/blob/master/functions/matchers.ts#L19)

### Future plans

* add pretty CLI graphs.
* foldable breakdowns to view what you want without so much noise.
* maybe a http server/api.
* feature requests?

i made this on my phone.
